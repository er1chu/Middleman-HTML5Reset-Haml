# Middleman Project Template: HTML5-RESET + HAML

CSS from [HTML5 RESET](http://html5reset.org/) adapted as a HAML [Middleman 3.x](http://middlemanapp.com/) project template with [Amazium](http://www.amazium.co.uk/) responsive grids ready to go, content using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), Coffeescript, Sprockets and more.

Using [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) and [RVM](https://rvm.io/) is **highly** recommended.

Edit me at /source/index.html.md and start making something beautiful.

## What to do First?

### Helpers

Take a look at [/helpers/](http://github.com/er1chu/Middleman-HTML5Reset-Haml/tree/master/helpers). There's a few methods to help DRY up a HTML5BP site that is built with Middleman. If you don't need it: just remove it and restart Middleman.

### Recommendations

* Update `.rvmrc` to the [gemset](https://rvm.io/gemsets/basics/) of your choosing (or remove it if you do not use [RVM](https://rvm.io/))
* Double check `.gitignore` and make sure it is what you want.
  * eg: `build/` is ignored by default.
* If you don't use `middleman init` to load the template, make sure to [use and run Bundler](http://gembundler.com/).
